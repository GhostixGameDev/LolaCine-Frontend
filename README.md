# LolaCine Frontend - Event Voting System

Welcome to **LolaCine 2024 Frontend**! This is a React-based website built for a local event where schools submit short films and vote on the best one. The project enables **electronic voting**, accessible through QR codes, ensuring that everyone can easily vote during the event.

### Features:
- **Vote on Proposals**: Users can vote once for their favorite film. All proposals are fetched from a backend API.
- **Group Presentations**: Proposals are divided into 4 groups, reflecting the event's structure.
- **Admin Page**: There is a dedicated admin interface for managing the event.
- **Voting Time**: Voting can be disabled in the admin interface.

### Backend Notice:
Please note that the backend is hosted on free tier services. If the proposals are not loading immediately, kindly allow a minute or two for the server to wake up.

Feel free to explore the website. This platform aims to enhance the voting experience and provide accessibility to all attendees.

### Technology Stack:
- **Frontend**: React.js
- **Backend**: Node.js (sleep-mode free hosting), Express
- **Database**: MySQL

This project demonstrates my ability to work with **React**, integrate **backend APIs**, and handle **dynamic voting systems** for real-world events.
